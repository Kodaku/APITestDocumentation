# Required Plugins

Now it's time to use the syntax learned in the previous sections to perform some basic API calls.

But before we dive into this topic here are listed the Jenkins plugins you need to install:

-   [http_request](https://plugins.jenkins.io/http_request/):  to send http requests
-   [pipeline-utility-steps](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-utility-steps/):  to parse the content of a response into a JSON
